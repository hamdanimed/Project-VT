1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:09,760
You go to Mars?
Nick has been count me out and

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,530
counting my bullets from low to
my clit.

3

So I'm writing down names, I'm making
a lists and checking it twice and

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,080
I'm getting them hit the real ones.
Been dying and fake losses.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,300
Let the game is off balance.
I'm back on my shit.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,240
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is
dirty. But that's how I like it.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,060
You all are my dick, Amal and my bag.
It's hardest to get.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,640
I do not do a powder.
I might take a sip, I might hit the

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,830
block. But I'm not about a trip.
I ain't popping no pill.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,960
But you do as you wish.
I wrote with some things.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,660
I love them to death.
I've got a few mail,

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,890

15
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,470
chips just for the rolling right
back on my wrists.

16
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,920
This last game friends really gave me
a gift that went around with rain.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,320
I just had like two letters.
Can that coexists?

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,270
But I never beef with a nigga
for nothing.

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,180
If I smoke, go Rap is coming legit.
It won't be for clout.

20
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,190
It won't be for fame.
It won't because my shit is

21
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,140
selling the same.
It won't be to sell you my

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,300
latest no sneakers.
It won't because some niggas sit

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,460
in my lane.
Everything grows is destined to

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,860
change. I love you low knickers.
I'm glad that you came.

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,650
I hope that you scrape every dollar
you paint I hope you know money.

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,500
Money raised a pain to the old G's.
I'm taking you now.

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,540
I was watching you when you was
paving the ground.

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,470
I can be joke to some average of
style.

29

some the greatest right now. Fuck.

31
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,240
Promise Still made all that noise.
The shit gonna be different.

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,150
I set my intentions.
I promise to separate out your voice.

33
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,040
It will tell me I'm telling my
bullies.

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm lower my clips,
I'm writing no names.

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm making a list and checking it
twice and I'm getting them hit the

36
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,470
real ones. Been dying the fake.

Foot is on a mic. I got to start.
Tell me. Give me something.

42
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,740
They can tell a bit about this
so I don't give a fuck.

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,670
Just a young man or man in the
middle. Two generations.

44
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,450
I'm little Brown, big bro.
Olive was just at the level,

45
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,240
you know, 21 Savage.
Somebody got me chicken for lunch.

46
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,890
Had a long chat with the young
nigger.

47
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,520
Kodak reminded me a young man
straight out to project No fake

48
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,070
and just honest I wish that he
had more Got is for real.

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,990
Too many niggas the psychologist
spinning the birds inside of a self.

50
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,990
We come from a long bloodline of
trauma we raised by mama's all

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,140
we got to. Here we are in us.
This is the baby.

52
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,340
This is where we kill enough brothers
They poison the well distorted self

53
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,670
them as we said at the fair I will
make sure that the real gun purveyor.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:53,470
I just put something in my cup.
I do want something I can promise.

55
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,760
I am never letting money open to
make Major.

56
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,930
But it is something that I got
to start.

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,310
I'm going to give them something
they can. Fitting boundaries.

58
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,560
I don't give a fuck.
Is there anyone in Omega here?

59
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:30,030
Just to make you aware.
Money your will make, Major.
