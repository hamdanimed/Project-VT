00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,030
So with the exam season already
well underway, I wanted to share a

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,790
last minute study tip that might
be able to help you out as well.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,690
So I really think the most
important thing is to just maintain

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,860
a pristine working environment.
So I always have a microfiber

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,230
cloth handy.
And what I like to do is turn

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,900
off the monitor.
And that allows me to more easile

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,220
see the reflection of my own tears.
Just wipe those away.
